Feature: Hello World
  As a DWP Academy Student
  I want to write my first acceptance test
  So that I can learn the BDD style!

Scenario: Say Hello to the World
  Given I have the Hello World project
  When I write a Hello World test
  Then I should be able to run it and see "Hello World" printed on screen
